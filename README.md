Android TagView
===============

Simple android view to display collection of colorful tags efficiently.

Library uses ```TextView``` as a base, and creates custom ```Spanes```
to achieve such effect. It is usable as static view in the layout,
as well in the list element without significant negative effect on it's performance.

Example usages can be found in *example* project.

Usage
===============

Basic usage
---------------

Add view to your layout. You can manipulate content with ```setTags``` method.

```
TagView tv = (TagView) getView().findViewById(R.id.tags_view);
TagView.Tag[] tags = {
    new TagView.Tag("Sample tag", Color.parseColor("#0099CC")),
    new TagView.Tag("Another one", Color.parseColor("#9933CC"))
};
tv.setTags(tags, " ");
```

To use default style of TagView, include this attribute in your theme:

```
<item name="tagViewStyle">@style/Widget.TagView</item>
```

Customization
---------------
TagView is derived from TextView, so all it's attributes should work.
Most important ones are ```textSize```, ```textStyle``` and ```textColor```.
Additional view properties are:

* ```tagCornerRadius``` - making corner round
* ```tagPadding``` - adding padding around the tag
* ```tagUppercase``` - making every tag uppercase.

You can inherit sane default values using style ```@style/Widget.TagView```
as a parent.
